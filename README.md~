IRLRealTime
===========

*disclosure, again i did not actually use version control but I am trying to get in better programming practice and starting up.
My real-time codesets which allow you to view fusion code in real-time as well as some corner detection

I still need to put the data up to google drive so that it is backed upa bit better.
