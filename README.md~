IRLRealTime
===========

*disclosure, again i did not actually use version control but I am trying to get in better programming practice and starting up.
My real-time codesets which allow you to view fusion code in real-time as well as some corner detection

I still need to put the data up to google drive so that it is backed up a bit better.

arr2int.m	| function which turns UDP bytes and flips them into int which can be read by MATLAB
arr2num.m	| generalized version of arr2int.m, flips bytes and returns hex from UDP bytes
calcdisp.m	| calculates the displacement of two 2-d clouds, assuming matches points line up (very shaky)
findclosept.m	| finds the first point in a point cloud close to another.  (DO NOT USE)
findclosepts.m	| finds the closest point in a pointcloud to a given point
